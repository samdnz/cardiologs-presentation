# Continuous delivery  
## A comprehensive model

-----

# Concepts 

* Pull discussion left
* Small units of work
* Independently deployable
* Trunk Development
* A Ubiquitous Dialect
* Staged and gated environments
* One path to Production
* One source of truth
* Measure trends and learn from mistakes

-----

# Pull discussion left

* Every activity and decision point should be done as early in the process as possible.
* Trending towards a goal where merging a pull request has no manual actions.

-----

## For example
* Security concerns should be raised and reviewed by the security team at refinement or story mapping... Or waived if no concerns are noted
* Architecture and design sessions happen with interested neighbors when a work item moves to in progress as a first step.
* Static code analysis in the IDE.
* Controls for a given deploy-able are pre-determined as a first step before even a hello world version.

-----

# Small units of work

* To ensure the delta of verification is minimal we deploy one thing and one feature at a time.
* Minimizes risks by limiting the amount of change
* Maps nicely to the agile user story model of INVEST (Independant, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) 

-----

# Independently deployable

* Extending the concept of small units of work and supporting a micro-services architecture we further reduce risk by deploying independent components that do one thing. 
* We implement standards ensuing non breaking changes on our public interfaces for our consumers (internal and external)  

-----

# Trunk development 

* We invert our expectation and say any commit on main should be in production unless a control is failed
* Through frequent (continuous) use issues in our Continuous Integration system in deploying to all stages are identified and quickly resolved
* We use short lived feature branches in the order of less then a day between creation and merge
* A Broken build on main is Priority for all teams involved in this domain.
* Minimal sufficient code review 
* Team ownership of life-cycle

-----

# A Ubiquitous Dialect

* Establish a known and consistent set of terms for our stages, controls, reviews and process
* Use these throughout the organization
* Avoid acronyms and abbreviations
* Focus on intent

-----

## For example  

-----

# Staged and gated environments

![stages and example controls](./images/stages.png)

* Example controls would be submitted only on a main build, failures and issues are visible short term for feature branches  

-----

## Verify - All branches -- Used by Developers and Automation

* Your developers local machine or a CICD runner 
* The owner of a branch is responsible to fix on a branch. It would be very very rare to break main at this stage.... Only a bad merge
 
-----

* We Run tests in this stage that prove developers intent of individual components within our repository

-----

## Example controls  

* Unit test report
* Style compliance report

-----

## Build - All branches -- Used by Automation only

* Your developers local machine or a CICD runner
* This stage creates an immutable deployable (Open Container Image)

-----

* We run tests proving developers intent regarding the packaged software and composition

-----

## Example controls 

* Integration test report
* Container content verification

-----

## Acceptance - All branches - Humans may use for QA and demo

* A decoupled environment is deployed for each feature branch here
* Every dependency possible is mocked and abstracted allowing a focus on the deployed component, not other items minimizing investigation time. 
** Think in memory databases and mocked network APIs.
* There is garbage collection to clean up older branch acceptance environments or could be entirely ephemeral in our runners or both

-----
 
* We run test scenarios specified in terms of our feature acceptance criteria 

-----

## Example controls

* end to end Acceptance test report
* software supply-chain security report
* Perhaps a few our generated r-docs

-----

## Union - Main only - Humans May demo in this environment

* A shared namespace where all deployable are deployed 
* union instance dependancies are available and running from their own Continuous Deployment Models 
* Each team maintains their applications under a support agreement.
* So that other teams can rely on your service being up to date and working as not to block their verification and release. 
* It is kept close to production.  

-----

* We should trend away from having the main head in this environment but not production

-----

* We run test scenarios to ensure interoperability and core journey of our deployable is successful

-----

## Example controls

* Union test end to end report
* More of our R-docs this may be where we start submitting manual documents
* Product team Approval
* Change management approval
* (Stretch goal FDA approval document from a full generated 510k)  

-----

## Rehearsal - Main only - AUTOMATION ONLY

* A final environment 
* kept as close to production data as possible... Obfuscated and perhaps reduced

-----

* we run tests that verify our upgrade process has been successful.

-----

## Example controls

* rehearsal test report
* operation readiness
* executive approval
* The most difficult compliance documents that is unlikely to change  

-----

## Production - Main only - Its production

* We can and should (Almost MUST) use feature flags to decouple release and publishing to customers,
* We may present ab testing options to real customers.
* We may use incremental rollout or Cannery deployment to further reduce risk.  
* But it is only operational reasons preventing a customer accessing our new features. 

-----

## Getting there (Hypothetical) 

* Data-model supports version n and n-1 to avoid data migration rollbacks
* roll forward with needed changes only
* re-deploy a previous OCI in case of a production or rehearsal failure
* Patterns allowing graceful degradation, Circuit breaker

-----

# One path to Production

* The trigger of any release is always a commit to main with a pull request
* Only "Pipelines" are authorized to make changes
* Infrastructure as application services embedded in our manifests. Cross plane in K8S
* Platform as a service also follows this path development

-----

## Why one path

* Ensures traceability and chain of custody for every production change
* Prevents human error

-----

# One source of truth

* Required controls (and evidence) are defined in the repository of each deployable; including who must submit them.
* Code-owners define who can approve changes to controls.

-----

* Ci/Cd action runners are aware of controls submitted and Must wait between stages.
* Ci/Cd actions may generate required control documents and in its final form will generate all controls 

* An admissions controller ensures annotations link to a record proving of all required controls are satisfied. (K8S control plane, GITOPS Repository automation).

-----   

* An interface for humans that shows what must yet happen for a given commit to reach production

* Manual controls are submitted in this interface to smooth tradition but may always be needed in some cases.

* Submitted controls are archived and retrievable in the correct system of record.

-----

# Measure trends and learn from mistakes

* With great power comes responsibility
* We propose and implement metrics and measures showing all these principles are being followed and trending in a positive direction.
* We ensure blame free postmortems are undertaken and review actions arising on a regular bases before we archive and close an incident.
