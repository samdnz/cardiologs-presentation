# The mysterious polls 

* The poll questions I sent over the past months are a peer reviewed and highly cited survey designed to assess org culture.

* The servey method recommends the subject population have minimal knowledge. 
* The terms are rather loaded and as such bias can be introduced, e.g. No one wants to think they are in an Pathologic culture
* Real world manifestations of these cultures are subtle. 

-----

# Westrum organizational topologies.

* 35ish Years ago Ron Westrum publish some of the most cited reseach in classifing organizational culture.    
* Focusing on high risk technology and engineering firms (Heathcare / Aviation)... But applicable universally.

* 3 Types of Org

-----

# Pathological - Power based
* Failure and blame lead to low co-operation.
* People build empires and hoard information for personal gain. 
* "Thats Sam's area I couldn't possibly help you with X"


-----

-----

# Bureaucratic - Rules Based

* Well defined but rigid responsibilities prevent collaboration or learning.
* New ideas are scary
* "We aren't allowed to do thats... Why? Our Rules says so." 

-----

![rules](./images/no.png)

-----

# Generative - Performance Based

* Risks and learnings are shared and leveraged for improvement. 
* New ideas are supported and implemented
* "France we intend to implement a new architecture, it will allow us to support international markets with less lead time" - Pulse team
  "Very well. Continue" - France

# Overall

* 1335 of a possible 1617 points based on the people that responded.

* Be careful this sounds good but there is some clustering that would be hidden in the law of averages. 

-----

# Three top areas to think about

* Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of failures or other bad news.

* and 
 
* On my team, failures are treated primarily as opportunities to improve the system.

* and 
 
* On my team, cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded.
